# References for managed-identity file ingestion

Checked 2026-10-30 against official Microsoft documentation:

- [Azure Blob Storage system-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-blob-storage#system-assigned-managed-identity-authentication): serviceEndpoint, storage permissions and binary copying.
- [ADLS Gen2 system-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-data-lake-storage#system-assigned-managed-identity-authentication): AzureBlobFS URL and destination permissions.

Neither managed-identity mode requires a Key Vault secret. Omitting an unused vault
does not change authentication fields or the requirement for storage data access.

The Blob connector also documents `connectVia` as optional: omitting it uses the
default Azure integration runtime. Accessed 2026-10-30.
